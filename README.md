# Bakery

A mod for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) that adds various miscellaneous things, created by BakersDozenBagels.

Additions are generally meant to be well-balanced with vanilla, although the decks are a bit wackier.

Current contents:

- 21 Jokers
- 4 Tags
- 3 Decks
- 3 [Deck Sleeves](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves)
- 2 Blinds
- 2 Challenges
- 2 Spectral Cards
- 1 Enhancement
- Miscellaneous modding API features (If this mod does something interesting, it can probably be used as a dependency to do that thing)

## Installation

1. Bakery requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods). Follow the instructions to install it if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository into your mods folder, or download it as a zip and place it there.
3. Enjoy!

## Lite Version

If another mod depends on Bakery, but you do not want Bakery's additions, you can install the [lite version](https://github.com/BakersDozenBagels/BalatroBakery/tree/lite). This version only has a modding API and nothing else. Note that both versions can be installed together without issue.
